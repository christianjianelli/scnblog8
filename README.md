========

Building a Single-Page Application (SPA) with AngularJS and Bootstrap CSS to consume a REST API based on {z}restapi and token authentication

See sample at http://www.jianelli.com.br/scnblog8 
Note: this sample app uses a php backend that emulates SAP WebAS {z}restapi responses and is intended to show how the app looks like.
